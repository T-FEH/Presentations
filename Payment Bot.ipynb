    "- Imagine a world where making payments is as easy as chatting. That's what we're talking about – payment bots. They're like smart robots that help us pay online in a super simple way. In this presentation, i will give insights on how to make these bots and see how they're changing the payment game."

    "\n",
    "- A Payment Receiving Bot is like a digital assistant that helps businesses and individuals collect money online. It's a computer program that can handle the process of receiving payments from customers. Just like you might chat with a friend, you can interact with this bot to get paid for products or services. It makes the whole payment process easier and more automated which is great because it saves time and makes things easier for both businesses and customers."

    "- **Payment Gateway APIs**: Payment gateway APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are essential for integrating payment processing into your bot."
